#  Graph Neural Network-Based Joint Beamforming for Hybrid Relay and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Aided Multiuser Systems

## Introduction:
This study examines a downlink multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, where a base station (BS) with
multiple antennas sends data to multiple single-antenna users with the help of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and a half-duplex decode-and-forward (DF) relay. The systemâ€™s sum rate is maximized through joint optimization of active beamforming at the BS and DF relay and passive beamforming at the RIS by graph neural network (GNN)
